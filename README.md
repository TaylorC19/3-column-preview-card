## Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

![Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Explanation
This is my attempt at the Frontend Mentor (www.frontendmentor.io) challenge (3-column preview card component challenge hub).

I am very new to web development (I started learning about a week before 2022), so this was to help me get some HTML and CSS practice.

Note: This is only a desktop design that is missing features (see below)

## Missing Features (Help)
While this shows up mostly right on my page, this is missing responsiveness (or adaptability). The left-middle-right containers do not remain the same height as you adjust the page width. I would appreciate tips on how to maintain a constant height

I am not sure how to round **only** the outer edges.

As I said, I am very much a beginner, so any tips would be appreciated. Thank you
