# 3-column-preview-card
This is an attempt at a challenge problem form frontend mentor (www.frontendmentor.io), the "3-column preview card component challenge hub" challenge. This is exclusively a desktop solution
This attempt is missing responsitivity (or adaptability) for various screen-sizes. I am struggling with assuring that the left-middle-right divs are the same size no matter how the page is adjusted.
I am new to web-development (both html and css), so I would appreciate any tips on these challenges.
